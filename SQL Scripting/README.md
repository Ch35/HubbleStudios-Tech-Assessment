# SQL Scripting

There are 2 files in this folder. Namely "Sales.sql" and "SalesQuery.sql".

`Sales.sql` should contain the entire query (including temporary table creation). Run this to test the query.
`SalesQuery.sql` should just contain the answer to the question.

## Assumptions
- The currency of the product will only be ZAR
- The system DB software is MySQL or MariaDB
